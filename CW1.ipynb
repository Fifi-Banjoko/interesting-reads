    "In an era dominated by digital communication, social media platforms have become powerful tools for connectivity and expression. However, this newfound connectivity has brought with it the insidious rise of hateful speech and toxic behavior, posing significant challenges for maintaining a healthy online discourse. Recognizing the evolving nature of such harmful content, traditional text classifiers often fall short in accurately identifying and mitigating instances where individuals creatively replace letters with symbols to disguise their derogatory language.\n",
    "\n",
    "This underscores the critical need for an advanced text classification system, one that not only distinguishes hateful from non-hateful content but also possesses the sophistication to decipher the subtle nuances of symbol-laden expressions. Enter a text classifier designed to address the growing sophistication of language manipulation on social media. By leveraging cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this algorithm transcends the limitations of conventional models, offering a robust defense against the ever-expanding arsenal of creative obfuscation tactics employed by individuals seeking to spread hate.\n",

    "Traditional text classifiers often struggle to effectively address the evolving sophistication of language manipulation employed by individuals seeking to spread hate. To bridge this gap, recent research has focused on the development of innovative text classification systems that leverage cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques to decipher the subtle nuances of symbol-laden expressions and creatively obfuscated language (Gitari et al. 2015). This literature review aims to explore the domain-specific areas, objectives, datasets, evaluation methodologies, architectures, and capabilities of state-of-the-art hate speech detection classifiers, with a focus on the advancements in machine learning and deep learning-based approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several scholarly works have delved into the landscape of hate speech Fortuna et al. 2018, provided a detailed overview of hate speech automatic detection using machine learning and deep learning models, highlighting the binary and multi-class output considerations in hate speech detection. Furthermore, a systematic literature review by Mohiyaddeen et al. (2021) examined different machine learning methods for hate speech detection and experimental approaches in this critical area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some existing literature focus on specific groups that are subject to hate speech. Kwarteng et al (2022) explores the complexities and challenges associated with detecting misogynoir, which refers to the anti-Black forms of misogyny that Black women experience. The study highlights the inherent subjectivity and intersectional nature of misogynoir, which combines racism and sexism, making it particularly challenging to detect. González-Pizarro and Zannettou (2023), introduce a large pre-trained model that utilizes the Contrastive Learning paradigm to identify and understand and identify a set of Antisemitic and Islamophobic hateful textual phrases on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "The existing literature has also identified several gaps and challenges in hate speech detection, including the need for robust feature sets that can be applied to diverse datasets, as well as the development of methodologies for rigorous dataset comparison and evaluation. In terms of the ethics of hate speech classification, Davidson et al (2019) examines racial bias in five different sets of Twitter data annotated for hate speech and abusive language. The study trains classifiers on these datasets and compares the predictions of these classifiers on tweets. The results demonstrate evidence of systematic racial bias in all datasets, as classifiers trained on them tend to predict that tweets written in African-American English are more likely to be abusive. The paper highlights the potential discriminatory impact of using these abusive language detection systems, particularly against groups that are often the targets of abuse. "

    "This classifier leverages supervised machine learning, relying on labeled hate speech text for effective training. Numerous annotated hate speech datasets are available, targeting various forms of abusive and hateful language such as racism, misogyny, sexism, homophobia, and religious hate. Notable datasets include The Gab Hate Corpus and UCBerkeley's Measuring Hate Speech Corpus (Vidgen & Derczynski, 2020). However, hate speech is intricate, tied to group dynamics, and depends on subtle linguistic nuances (Fortuna & Nunes, 2018). As González & Zannettou, 2023 pointed out, existing datasets often focus on specific modalities within hate speech, aligning with their particular definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, to construct a robust classifier accommodating diverse definitions of hate speech, three distinct datasets were combined from prominent online platforms—Twitter, Reddit, 4Chan, and YouTube. The first dataset, derived from HateSonar on Twitter, encompasses six columns: tweet (lightly preprocessed tweets), count (number of CrowdFlower users coding each tweet), hate_speech (number of users judging the tweet as hate speech), offensive_language (number of users judging the tweet as offensive), neither (number of users judging the tweet as neither offensive nor non-offensive), and class label (0 for hate speech, 1 for offensive language, 2 for neither). The second dataset, Figshare's Labelled Hate Speech Detection Dataset, comprises three columns: platform (where the data was obtained), comment (text data), and hateful label (0 for not hateful, 1 for hateful), incorporating data from Reddit, Twitter, and 4Chan. The third dataset, UCBerkeley's Measuring Hate Speech Corpus of over 100,000 text instances, includes mixed social media comments with notable columns such as hate speech score (continuous hate speech measure) and hatespeech (class label: 0 for non-hateful, 1 for offensive language, 2 for hate speech).\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets were merged, subset and preprocessed, resulting in a balanced dataset of 10,000 data points, evenly distributed between 5,000 instances of hate speech and 5,000 instances of non-hate speech. The final dataset includes two columns: \"text,\" containing the text data as strings, and \"hateful,\" a binary integer column with 0 for non-hateful labels and 1 for hateful labels."

    "Given the nature of this hate speech classification, where false positives (misclassifying non-hateful content as hateful) and false negatives (misclassifying hateful content as non-hateful) can have different implications, a combination of **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score** is used as the main evaluation metrics. High precision is crucial when false positives are costly or undesirable. In the context of hate speech classification, mislabeling non-hateful content as hateful might lead to unnecessary restrictions on user expression, so minimizing false positives is important. High recall is important when false negatives are costly. In the context of hate speech, missing instances of actual hate speech can have severe consequences, so capturing as many instances as possible is crucia. F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced measure. It is suitable when there is a need to strike a balance between minimising false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of metrics is used to get a comprehensive understanding of the classifier's performance.  After carefully analysing the potential consequences of false positives and false negatives in this application, the primary concern is to ensure that as much actual hate speech as possible is detected and mitigated, even at the cost of some false positives, hence **recall** is prioritised. Emphasising recall aims to capture a higher proportion of true positive instances, reducing the chances of missing actual instances of hate speech. In practical application of this classifier prioritisation is regularly reassessed and adjusted based on user feedback, evolving requirements, and societal impact."

To mitigate this without having to apply techniques to an imbalanced dataset, hateful instances from the different dataset are pooled together, likewise for the non-hateful instances. This results in some data being used from each of the datasets. After, natural language preprocessing techniques necessary for social media data such as removing emoticons and emojis, removing punctuation, removing usernames and hashtags, lemmatizing, removing stop words and correcting spelling of words (so misspelled stopwords will also be removed) are applied. Some context specific preprocessing techniques such as removing standalone numerics but not numerics in between words and handling letter variations for when number and symbols are swapped for letters when hateful speech is used are also applied. \n",

    "To get a baseline perfomance, a simple Naive Bayes algorithm was implemented. Naive Bayes is a good baseline algorithm due to its simplicity, computational efficiency, and effectiveness with high-dimensional, sparse text data. This makes it a good starting point for this classifier.\n",
    "The recall of the algorithm is 86% which indicates that the model correctly identifies 86% of all instances of hateful text in the dataset. This metric is since it is important to capture as many instances of hateful text as possible, minimizing false negatives. The accuracy of approximately 82% indicates that the model is making correct predictions for a significant majority of the cases. The precision of 79% for hateful instances (hateful - 1) indicate that the model is correct about 79% of the time in predicting hateful text."

    "For this project, a diverse set of four classifiers—logistic regression, SVM, random forest, and LSTM—was employed to identify hateful speech. The features of these models consist of vectorized text, utilizing either CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, or GloVe word embeddings where appropriate. The binary labels indicate whether the text is classified as hateful or not. The selection of these classifiers was motivated by the aim to leverage the diversity in their decision-making processes, allowing for a robust comparison of their performance to determine the most suitable algorithm for the classifier's future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each classifier was chosen based on its relevance to the classification task, taking into account factors such as interpretability, capacity to handle non-linearity, and ability to capture sequential dependencies in text data. Logistic regression was selected for its simplicity and interpretability, SVM for its effective performance on high-dimensional data, random forest for its adeptness in handling non-linear relationships and capturing complexity, and LSTM for its specialized design to work with sequential data and capture long-term dependencies. The features and labels were tailored to align with the unique characteristics of each classifier, and extensive experimentation was conducted to achieve optimal performance. Lastly, Grid Search optimization was applied to each classifier to enhance their evaluation metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score."

    "In the pursuit of optimizing model performance, an exhaustive hyperparameter tuning process was executed through grid search. Despite these efforts, the optimization of classifiers did not produce the anticipated results. For instance, in the case of logistic regression, the recall scores experienced a reduction, while for the support vector machine, they remained unchanged. Although there was a marginal increase in recall with the random forest model, the results obtained from the long short-term memory (LSTM) network were not interpretable. Given the limited success of grid search optimization, alternative strategies for enhancing recall are being explored. These include experimenting with different feature engineering techniques, exploring more sophisticated model architectures, and potentially incorporating ensemble methods to harness the strengths of multiple models. By diversifying the approach beyond hyperparameter tuning, we aim to uncover avenues that will lead to substantial improvements in the models' ability to identify relevant patterns and enhance recall performance."

    "The study is centered around the development of a hate speech classifier, addressing the inherent challenges associated with text data. To counter the imbalance between hateful and non-hateful instances, a strategic preprocessing pipeline is implemented. This involves pooling instances from different datasets to create a more balanced representation. Subsequent natural language preprocessing techniques are applied, including the removal of emoticons, emojis, punctuation, usernames, hashtags, lemmatization, stop word removal, and spelling correction. Additionally, context-specific preprocessing, such as handling variations in letter usage for numerics and symbols, is undertaken.\n",
    "\n",
    "To establish a baseline performance, a Naive Bayes algorithm is employed. The classifier exhibits an 86% recall, highlighting its efficacy in correctly identifying instances of hateful text. The subsequent introduction of four diverse classifiers—logistic regression, SVM, random forest, and LSTM—further explores the landscape of hate speech classification. The choice of classifiers is motivated by their unique decision-making processes, ranging from simplicity and interpretability to the capacity to handle non-linearity and sequential dependencies in text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite comprehensive preprocessing and model selection, an exhaustive hyperparameter tuning process does not yield the anticipated improvements. Logistic regression and SVM consistently demonstrate comparable recall performance, standing out as strong performers. Random forest, while excelling in identifying negative instances, exhibits a slightly lower recall for positive instances. The LSTM model, designed for sequential data, presents a recall performance that falls in between. In light of the limited success of grid search optimization, the study explores alternative strategies for improving recall. This includes experimenting with different feature engineering techniques, exploring more sophisticated model architectures, and potentially incorporating ensemble methods. When compared with a common hate speech classifier, HateSonar, this calssifier accurately identifies hate speech with clever letter swapping."

    "The study reveals the intricacies of hate speech classification, highlighting the importance of diverse classifiers and thorough preprocessing. While Naive Bayes serves as a suitable baseline, logistic regression emerges as the most robust classifier, excelling in recall, precision, and F1 score. The challenges faced during hyperparameter tuning suggest the need for a broader approach, including innovative feature engineering and ensemble methods, to enhance recall performance. The findings underscore the complexities in optimizing hate speech classifiers and emphasize the ongoing need for research to improve model capabilities in identifying relevant patterns and minimizing misclassifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this study classifies hate speech using simple classification techniques and performs better when words have been swapped against the HateSonar hate speech detector, it is essential to clarify that detecting hate speech involves more than just checking individual words—it often involves context, intent, and understanding the nuances of language which many simple classifiers are not be equipped to do."
