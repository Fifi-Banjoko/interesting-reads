The dataset utilized in the "Cosmic Classifier" project originates from the Galaxy Zoo project, a groundbreaking initiative that provides visual morphological classifications for nearly one million galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This extensive dataset is the result of collaborative efforts involving more than 100,000 volunteers who participated in the Galaxy Zoo project by visually inspecting and classifying galaxies through an online platform. This inclusive approach, involving the general public, has led to over 4 Ã— 10^7 individual classifications, contributing to the creation of a robust morphological catalogue.

Motivated by the need to obtain accurate morphological classifications without the introduction of biases associated with proxies such as color, concentration, or structural parameters, the Galaxy Zoo project has demonstrated its effectiveness in generating reliable morphological data. The classifications performed by the volunteers have been found to be consistent with those made by professional astronomers on subsets of SDSS galaxies, affirming the reliability of the dataset. The dataset chosen from this project is the Galaxy Zoo2 dataset. This dataset consists of a total of 243,434 images, each capturing the unique morphology of galaxies observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These images serve as the foundation for the "Cosmic Classifier" project, aiming to leverage advanced machine learning and image analysis techniques for the automated classification of galaxies into two primary categories: spiral and elliptical. Along with these images are two datasets containing the image information, features and galaxy labels of this data.

The extensive participation of volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project not only facilitated the creation of this valuable dataset but also underscores the collaborative nature of scientific endeavors in the exploration of our cosmic surroundings. The individual contributions of more than 100,000 volunteers who participated in the Galaxy Zoo project are duly acknowledged, highlighting the collective effort that has made this dataset a cornerstone for advancing our understanding of galactic structures.
