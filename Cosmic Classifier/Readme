In the vast expanse of our cosmic tapestry, galaxies stand as celestial entities with diverse forms and structures. Understanding and classifying these galaxies based on their shapes—whether they exhibit the graceful spirals or the more enigmatic ellipticals—is a crucial task in the realm of astronomy. This project, aptly named "Cosmic Classifier," embarks on the mission to decipher the cosmic morphology, offering a systematic approach to the classification of galaxies. The challenge lies in the sheer volume and complexity of astronomical data. As telescopes capture images of galaxies scattered across the universe, the need for automated classification methods becomes increasingly apparent. Identifying the structural characteristics of galaxies is not only a key aspect of astronomical research but also a fundamental step towards unraveling the mysteries of the universe's evolution.

The primary goal of the "Cosmic Classifier" project is to develop a robust and efficient system for the classification of galaxies using galaxy images into two primary categories: spiral and elliptical. By harnessing the power of deep learning and image analysis, this project seeks to create a tool that can navigate the intricacies of galactic forms, providing astronomers and researchers with a powerful means to streamline their analyses. Through this project, we aim to contribute to the broader understanding of our cosmic surroundings and foster advancements in the field of astronomy.
